# X-Tag: from Prototype to Product

[X-Tag](https://github.com/x-tag/core) has undergone a complete rewrite of the library the currently lives at [Mozilla/X-Tag](https://github.com/mozilla/x-tag).  Originally, X-Tag was a proof of concept that allowed us to do one thing, create cool custom tags.  We didn't attempt to polyfill the W3C spec and essentially created our own syntax and lifecycle events.  This was great for experimenting, but now that Chrome and Firefox are beginning to implement the spec, we need to get on board and ensure that we're compatible!


## What has changed? Just about everything!


*First*, we created a real polyfill for `document.register` that adheres to the spec.  This includes lifecycle events and prototypical element inheritance.  It's still a work in progress, so contributions are welcome.

*Second*, we re-designed X-Tag to work on top of the polyfill and to only include the essentials.  Meet X-Tag/Core.

Unfortunately, X-Tag 1.0 will not be compatible with the previous version.  The main reason is because we chose to ditch our way of declaring custom elements that looked like this.


```
<x-code-prism language="javascript">
xtag.register('accordion', {
  onUpgrade: function(){},
  onInsert: function(){},
  events: {
    'click:delegate(x-toggler)': function(){}
  },
  getters: {
    'togglers': function(){}
  },
  setters: {
    'togglers': function(val){}
  },
  methods: {
    nextToggler: function(){},
  }
});
</x-code-prism>
```

And went something that is closer to the spec version.  We are doing a little magic here to make your life easier.  We also provide cool things like pseudos.

```
<x-code-prism language="javascript">
xtag.register('x-growbox', {
    lifecycle: { // NEW
      created: function(){},
      inserted: function(){},
      removed: function(){},
      attributeChanged: function(){}
    },
    prototype: { // You can pass prototypes and we will create a new obj for you },
    accessors: { // New way of declaring getters/setters
      orientation: {
        get: function(){},
        set: function(value){}
      }
    },
    methods: {  // SAME
      matchDimensions: function(){}
    },
    events: { // SAME 
      'click:delegate(x-toggler)': function(){}, 
    }
  });
</x-code-prism>
```

Here's the raw spec polyfill.  

```
<x-code-prism language="javascript">
document.register('x-foo',{
    lifecycle: { // NEW
      created: function(){},
      inserted: function(){},
      removed: function(){},
      attributeChanged: function(){}
    },
    prototype: Object.create(window.HTMLSpanElement.prototype, {
      foo:{
        value: function(){
          console.log("foo log");
        }
      }
    })
});
</x-code-prism>

```

It's more powerful and substantially faster. WIN WIN!

## What about the old elements?

All the old elements that live at [Mozilla/X-Tag-Elements](https://github.com/mozilla/x-tag-elements) are deprecated as well.  We will be rewriting them and moving them to individual repositories under the [X-Tag Organization](https://github.com/x-tag) on Github.
